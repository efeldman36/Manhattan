**Observations of Mahanttan AirBnBs**  
For our group, the qualities that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live in are safety or low crime, affordability, access to transportation, convenient location, good public schools, more jobs, and access to other amenities (restaurants, parks, gyms, grocery stores, etc.). The three most important qualities for us are safety, affordability, and convenient location. We consider these three qualities to be the most essential because when choosing a neighborhood to live in, you want to feel safe in your home and walking around your neighborhood; you want to be able to comfortably afford your rent every month; and you want your apartment to be in a convenient location in terms of having easy access to transportation and a short commute time to work or other places around the city.

Manhattan has by far the highest average price of airbnb listings with an average price of almost $200 per day. Manhattan’s average price is 2 times larger than Queens and Bronx and almost 1.75 times larger than Brooklyn and Staten Island. Brooklyn has the second highest average price of airbnb listings. Then in third, fourth and fifth it goes Staten Island, Queens Bronx respectively. Looking at our individual neighborhoods in Manhattan, Chinatown has an average price of $160. East Harlem has an average price of $135. East Village has an average price of $180. West Village has an average price of $265. Both East and West Village significantly bring up Manhattan's average price. There is no clear trend between minimum number of nights required to book a listing and price of Airbnb listings across Manhattan: most of the data stayed close to the origin (low price and few number of nights required), but there were a few outliers where a high minimum number of nights (three outliers with 1000+ nights) is associated with a low price per night or a small minimum number of nights is associated with an astronomical price (three outliers with $10,000 per night)

Across all neighborhoods, Tribeca has, by far, the highest average price per night at almost $500 a night. The next highest is Battery Park City at $360 a night, followed by the Financial District at $350 a night. The lowest average price per night positions are taken by Inwood and Washington Heights, which both have an average of $100 a night. This reflects our borough average of $200 a night well, as there is a wide range of prices across all neighborhoods but most range from $150 - $250 a night.
