## Neighborhood Desirability  
For our group, the three most important qualities that make a neighborhood a desirable place to live in are safety, affordability, and convenient location. When choosing a neighborhood to live in, you want to feel safe in your home and walking around your neighborhood; you want to be able to comfortably afford your rent every month; and you want your apartment to be in a convenient location in terms of having easy access to transportation and a short commute time to work or other places around the city. As such, in our data analysis of Airbnbs in Manhattan below, we paid particularly close attention to statistics related to these three factors.

## Airbnb Statistics in Manhattan  

_**Exhibit 1: NUMBER OF LISTINGS**_

#### The number of listings in all boroughs is 48895. The number of listings in Manhattan is 21661.

Almost half of the listings in all boroughs are in Manhattan (44%). This shows that Manhattan is a highly desirable area to live in, likely because it offers a vibrant lifestyle full of activities and jobs available to people of all ages.  

_**Exhibit 2: AVERAGE PRICE PER BOROUGH**_

Manhattan has by far the highest average price of Airbnb listings with an average price of almost $200 per day. Manhattan’s average price is 2 times greater than Queens and Bronx and almost 1.75 times greater than Brooklyn and Staten Island. Brooklyn has the second highest average price of Airbnb listings, followed by Staten Island, Queens, and Bronx.

Across all Manhattan neighborhoods, Tribeca has the highest average price by far at almost $500 a night. The next highest is Battery Park City at $360 a night, followed by the Financial District at $350 a night. The lowest average price per night positions are taken by Inwood and Washington Heights, which both have an average of $100 a night. This reflects our borough average of $200 a night well, as there is a wide range of prices across all neighborhoods but most range from $150 - $250 a night.  

_**Exhibit 4: AVERAGE PRICE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS**_

Only one of our neighbourhoods exceeds the Manhattan borough average, and that is West Village, which has an average price of about $265. East Village takes the second highest spot at $186 a night. Chinatown is third at $160 a night, and East Harlem is least expensive at about $135 a night. This aligns closely with our own rankings for neighborhood desirability in HC3, in which we rated West Village and East Village as highly desirable, Chinatown as next desirable, and East Harlem as comparatively least desirable.  

_**Exhibit 5: ROOM TYPE PER LISTING IN MANHATTAN**_

<img src="pie of room listings.png" class="inline"/>

In Manhattan, almost two thirds of all Airbnb listings offered are entire homes or apartments. Over a third of listings offered are private rooms and just 2.2% are shared rooms. We can surmise that this is due to Manhattan being a prime vacation location where tenants are more likely willing to stay in a private, open space without having to see their landlord. It would be a nice family-friendly apartment with space available to cook or relax. The private rooms are more likely to be rented by individuals who are travelling alone. The shared rooms are very few but may be more budget friendly or desirable to those wanting to meet new people. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, room type may also be considered a safety feature, as travelers might prefer to stay in an Airbnb that is an entire home/apt or at least a private room, rather than a shared room, in order to maintain social distance.  

_**Exhibit 6: AVERAGE NUMBER OF MINIMUM NIGHTS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS**_

<img src="average mini nights in our nbhds.png" class="inline"/>

West Village has the highest average number of minimum nights, with about 7.9. East Village follows at 6.5 minimum nights, and East Harlem and Chinatown are very close to each other, but East Harlem leads with 5.9 minimum nights and Chinatown with 5.8 minimum nights. Minimum nights is very important because the longer the guest stays in the space, the more money they have to pay and the higher the profit for the host.  

_**Exhibit 7: AVERAGE NUMBER OF REVIEWS PER MONTH PER BOROUGH**_

<img src="average minimum nights in boroughs.png" class="inline"/>

The highest average number of reviews are for Airbnbs in Queens, where it draws in about 1.9 reviews per month. Next is Staten Island, which draws in about 1.83 reviews month, followed closely by the Bronx, with 1.80 reviews per month. Brooklyn has the fourth lease reviews per month, with 1.3, and Manhattan has the least, with 1.23 reviews per month. The number of reviews per month can indicate how long a tenant stays in the Airbnb. The longer the stay, the fewer the reviews since not as many groups can book the Airbnb in a period of time. 

_**Exhibit 8: AVERAGE NUMBER OF REVIEWS PER MONTH IN ALL MANHATTAN NEIGHBORHOODS**_

<img src="mini nights in all man nbhds.png" class="inline"/>

The average number of reviews for all neighborhoods is highest in the Theater District, with 2.7 reviews per month, followed by Tribeca, Hell’s Kitchen, and East Village. From this data, we can see that the places with higher rents, such as Tribeca and East Village, also have more reviews per month on average than other neighborhoods. 

_**Exhibit 9: AVERAGE NUMBER OF REVIEWS PER MONTH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS**_

<img src="average number of reviews per month in our nbhds.png" class="inline"/>

Although we designated the lowest rating of desirability to East Harlem, it has the highest average number of reviews per month, at 1.4. It is followed by Chinatown, with 1.15 reviews per month, East Village with .9 reviews per month, and lastly, West Village, with .7 reviews per month. This correlates directly with the average number of minimum nights. For example, because West Village requires the highest number of minimum nights, it also has the lowest average number of reviews because there are fewer tenants per month.  

_**Exhibit 10: MINIMUM NUMBER OF NIGHTS AND PRICE IN ALL MANHATTAN NEIGHBORHOODS**_

<img src="scatterplot.png" class="inline"/>

There is no clear trend between minimum number of nights required to book a listing and price of Airbnb listings across Manhattan: most of the data stayed close to the origin (low price and few number of nights required), but there were a few outliers where a high minimum number of nights (three outliers with 1000+ nights) is associated with a low price per night or a small minimum number of nights is associated with an astronomical price (three outliers with $10,000 per night).
